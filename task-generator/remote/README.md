# Buildah remote task generation
The Buildah task builds source code into a container image and pushes the image into container registry using the Buildah tool.
While the standard Buildah task runs directly on the cluster, the remote task is run on a remote host.
This must be used in combination with the Multi Arch Controller, which provides the credentials and host name used to perform the build.

The remote versions of the Buildah task are programmatically generated by this script from the buildah task to keep them in sync. The generated remote tasks should not be manually modified.

This tool is used by the `hack/generate-buildah-remote.sh` script.

## Arguments
- `buildah-task` - The location of the buildah task YAML file (required)
- `remote-task` - The location of the buildah-remote task YAML file to overwrite (required)
- `task-version` - The version of the task to overwrite, e.g. `0.2` (required)

Example usage:
```
go run remote/main.go \
 --buildah-task ../task/buildah/0.2/buildah.yaml \
 --remote-task ../task/buildah-remote/0.2/buildah-remote.yaml \
 --task-version 0.2
```
