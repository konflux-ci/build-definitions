# Migration from 0.4 to 0.5

Version 0.5:

* Fixes a regression where the SBOMs did not include the dependencies
  identified by Hermeto (from the prefetch task), making the SBOMs less accurate

## Action from users

No action required.

We consider the problem severe enough to require a new version (to raise awareness
and to let us deprecate the broken version faster). But you don't need to make
any manual changes.
