          This PR increases the size of $buildah_remote_oci_ta.

          Due to https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/8388, this is risky;
          the resulting bundle may not be resolvable by Tekton.

          Until the fix for the above issue is deployed in Konflux, your PR is blocked.
          Sorry!
