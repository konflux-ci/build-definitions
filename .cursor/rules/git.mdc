# git rules

## main branch
- main branch is read only, never push there directly
- for changes a new feature branch must be created
- pull requests are used to propose changes to the main branch

## commit message
- use conventional commits style
- write short but descriptive commit message
- avoid fluff in the text
- max line length should be 72 characters
- must contain sign-off git tailer with user ID, "git commit -s" option
- add "Assisted-by: Cursor AI" git trailer
