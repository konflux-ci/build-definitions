# sast-snyk-check task

## Description:

The sast-snyk-check task uses Snyk Code tool to perform Static Application Security Testing (SAST) for Snyk, a popular cloud-native application security platform.

Snyk's SAST tool uses a combination of static analysis and machine learning techniques to scan an application's source code for potential security vulnerabilities, including common issues such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and code injection attacks.
