  The task packages and pushes a Helm chart to an OCI repository.
  As Helm charts require to have a semver-compatible version to be packaged, the
  task relies on git tags in order to determine the chart version during runtime.

  The task computes the version based on the git commit SHA distance from the latest
  tag prefixed with the value of TAG_PREFIX. The value of that tag will be used as
  the version's X.Y values, and the Z value will be computed by the commit's distance
  from the tag, followed by an abbreviated SHA as build metadata.
