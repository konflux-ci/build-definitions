# buildah-remote task

This task is programmatically generated from the buildah task to keep it in sync, it should not be manually modified.

Buildah task builds source code into a container image and pushes the image into container registry using buildah tool, however while the standard buildah task is run directly on the cluster, this task is run on a remote host. This must be used in combination with the [Multi Arch Controller](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/multi-arch-controller) which provides the credentials and host name to use to perform the build.

This task has an additional `PLATFORM` param that is used by the Multi Arch Controller to decide which host should perform the build.
