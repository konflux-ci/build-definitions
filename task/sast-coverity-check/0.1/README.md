# sast-coverity-check task

## Description:

The sast-coverity-check task uses Coverity tool to perform Static Application Security Testing (SAST). In this task, we use the buildless mode, where Coverity has the ability to capture source code without the need of building the product.

The documentation for this mode can be found here: https://sig-product-docs.synopsys.com/bundle/coverity-docs/page/commands/topics/coverity_capture.html

The characteristics of these tasks are:

- Perform buildless scanning with Coverity
- The whole source code is scanned (by scanning `$(workspaces.source.path)` )
- Only important findings are reported by default.  A parameter ( `IMP_FINDINGS_ONLY`) is provided to override this configuration.
- The csdiff/v1 SARIF fingerprints are provided for all findings
- A parameter ( `KFP_GIT_URL`) is provided to remove false positives providing a known false positives repository. By default, no repository is provided.

> NOTE: This task is executed only if there is a Coverity license set up in the environment. Please check coverity-availability-check task for more information.
