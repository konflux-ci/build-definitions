    Build-maven-zip task builds prefetched maven artifacts into a OCI-artifact with zip bundle  and pushes the OCI-artifact into container registry.
    In addition it will use the SBOM file in prefetch-task, pushes the SBOM file to same registry of zip oci-artifact using cosign tool.
    Note that this task needs the output of prefetch-dependencies task. If it is not activated, there will not be any output from this task.
