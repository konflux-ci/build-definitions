  Process images from one bucket using fips-operator-check-step-action for FIPS compliance checking.

  This task is designed to work with matrix expansion on the BUCKET_INDEX parameter, enabling parallel processing of multiple buckets. It retrieves bucket files from a trusted artifact, prepares the images for processing, and runs FIPS compliance checks using the fips-operator-check-step-action.

  The task processes images in parallel within each bucket (controlled by MAX_PARALLEL parameter) and returns aggregated test results including success, failure, warning, and error counts.
