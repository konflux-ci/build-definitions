# s2i-java task

s2i-java task builds source code into a container image and pushes the image into container registry using S2I and buildah tool.
In addition it generates a SBOM file, injects the SBOM file into final container image and pushes the SBOM file as separate image using cosign tool.
When [Java dependency rebuild](https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.stonesoup.io/Documentation/main/cli/proc_enabled_java_dependencies.html) is enabled it triggers rebuilds of Java artifacts.
