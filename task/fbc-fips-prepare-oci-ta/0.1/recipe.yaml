  Extract images from all architectures, deduplicate, and split into buckets for following FIPS compliance checking in parallel.

  This task combines extraction, deduplication, and load-balanced bucket splitting in a single task. It extracts relatedImages from all unreleased operator bundle images from an FBC fragment, deduplicates them, and distributes them across multiple buckets using size-based load balancing. The buckets are stored as trusted artifacts for parallel processing.

  The task uses a greedy algorithm to distribute images by size, ensuring balanced workload distribution across buckets. This enables efficient parallel FIPS checking by processing different buckets concurrently.
