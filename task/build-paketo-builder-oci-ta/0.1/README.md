# build-paketo-builder-oci-ta task

The `build-paketo-builder-oci-ta` task builds a builder image (e.g. https://github.com/paketo-community/builder-ubi-base) for paketo using as input the [builder.toml](https://buildpacks.io/docs/reference/config/builder-config/) file. The image is build using the pack tool packaged part of the [paketo-container](https://github.com/konflux-ci/paketo-container/) image.
The task also produces the SBOM which is signed and added to the image.
