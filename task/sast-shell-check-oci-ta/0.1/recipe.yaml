  The sast-shell-check task uses [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) tool to perform Static Application Security Testing (SAST), a popular cloud-native application security platform. This task leverages the shellcheck wrapper (csmock-plugin-shellcheck-core) to run shellcheck on a directory tree.
