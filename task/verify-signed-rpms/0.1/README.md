# verify-signed-rpms.yaml task

## Description:
This tasks checks whether the images it is provided with contain any unsigned RPMs.

It can be used in two modes. Depending on the value of parameter `FAIL_UNSIGNED`, it
will either fail any run that find unsigned RPMs, or only report its finding without
failing (the latter is useful when running inside a build pipeline which tests the use of RPMs before their official release).
