# oci-copy task

Given an `oci-copy.yaml` file in the user's source directory, the `oci-copy` task will copy content from arbitrary urls into the OCI registry.

It generates a limited SBOM and pushes that into the OCI registry alongside the image.

It is not to be considered safe for general use as it cannot provide a high degree of provenance for artficats and reports them only as "general" type artifacts in the purl spec it reports in the SBOM. Use only in limited situations.

Note: the bearer token secret, if specified, will be sent to **all servers listed in the oci-copy.yaml file**.

## Parameters
|name|description|default value|required|
|---|---|---|---|
|IMAGE|Reference of the image buildah will produce.||true|
|OCI_COPY_FILE|Path to the oci copy file.|./oci-copy.yaml|false|
|BEARER_TOKEN_SECRET_NAME|Name of a secret which will be made available to the build as an Authorization header. Note, the token will be sent to all servers found in the oci-copy.yaml file. If you do not wish to send the token to all servers, different taskruns and therefore different oci artifacts must be used.|"does-not-exist"|false|


## Results
|name|description|
|---|---|
|IMAGE_DIGEST|Digest of the image just built|
|IMAGE_URL|Image repository where the built image was pushed|
|SBOM_BLOB_URL|Link to the SBOM blob pushed to the registry.|
|IMAGE_REF|Image reference of the built image|

## Workspaces
|name|description|optional|
|---|---|---|
|source|Workspace containing the source code to copy.|false|
