# The purpose of this pipeline is to execute the verify-enterprise-contract-v2 task for container
# images that are built but not automatically released in order to provide early feedback to users.
# When auto release is enabled, the task is executed by the release pipeline immediately after the
# container images are built, thus it is not necessary to execute the task via this pipeline.

    - name: SNAPSHOT
      type: string
      description: |
        Spec section of an ApplicationSnapshot resource. Not all fields of the
        resource are required. A minimal example:
          {
            "components": [
              {
                "containerImage": "quay.io/example/repo:latest"
              }
            ]
          }
        Each "containerImage" in the "components" array is validated.
    - name: POLICY_CONFIGURATION
      type: string
      description: |
        Name of the policy configuration (EnterpriseContractConfiguration
        object) to use. `namespace/name` or `name` syntax supported. If
        namespace is omitted the namespace where the task runs is used.
      default: enterprise-contract-service/default
    - name: SSL_CERT_DIR
      type: string
      description: |
        Path to a directory containing SSL certs to be used when communicating
        with external services. This is useful when using the integrated registry
        and a local instance of Rekor on a development cluster which may use
        certificates issued by a not-commonly trusted root CA. In such cases,
        "/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount" is a good value. Multiple
        paths can be provided by using the ":" separator.
      default: ""
    - name: PUBLIC_KEY
      type: string
      default: "k8s://openshift-pipelines/public-key"
      description: |
        Public key used to verify signatures. Must be a valid k8s cosign
        reference, e.g. k8s://my-space/my-secret where my-secret contains
        the expected cosign.pub attribute.
    - name: TIMEOUT
      type: string
      description: Timeout setting for `ec validate`.
      default: "5m0s"
    - name: CA_TRUST_CONFIGMAP_NAME
      type: string
      description: The name of the ConfigMap to read CA bundle data from.
      default: "trusted-ca"
    - name: CA_TRUST_CONFIG_MAP_KEY
      type: string
      description: The name of the key in the ConfigMap that contains the CA bundle data.
      default: "ca-bundle.crt"
