# The purpose of this pipeline is to execute the verify-enterprise-contract-v2 task for container
# images that are built but not automatically released in order to provide early feedback to users.
# When auto release is enabled, the task is executed by the release pipeline immediately after the
# container images are built, thus it is not necessary to execute the task via this pipeline.

  params:
    - name: SNAPSHOT
      type: string
      description: |
        Spec section of an ApplicationSnapshot resource. Not all fields of the
        resource are required. A minimal example:
          {
            "components": [
              {
                "containerImage": "quay.io/example/repo:latest"
              }
            ]
          }
        Each "containerImage" in the "components" array is validated.
    - name: POLICY_CONFIGURATION
      type: string
      description: |
        Name of the policy configuration (EnterpriseContractConfiguration
        object) to use. `namespace/name` or `name` syntax supported. If
        namespace is omitted the namespace where the task runs is used.
      default: enterprise-contract-service/default
    - name: SSL_CERT_DIR
      type: string
      description: |
        Path to a directory containing SSL certs to be used when communicating
        with external services. This is useful when using the integrated registry
        and a local instance of Rekor on a development cluster which may use
        certificates issued by a not-commonly trusted root CA. In such cases,
        "/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount" is a good value. Multiple
        paths can be provided by using the ":" separator.
